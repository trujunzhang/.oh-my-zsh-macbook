       Use :SPUpdate command to update all the plugins and SpaceVim itself.
           After :SPUpdate, you can assign plugins need to be updated. 
           Use Tab to complete plugin names after :SPUpdate.


* Get SpaceVim log
     
      Use :SPDebugInfo! command to display the log of SpaceVim. You also can use SPC h I to open a buffer with the issue template.


* Custom Configuration
  
    The very first time SpaceVim starts up, it will ask you to choose a mode, then it will create a SpaceVim.d/init.toml in your HOME directory. All User configurations can be stored in your ~/.SpaceVim.d directory.
