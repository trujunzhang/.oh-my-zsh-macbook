* Adding a deploy user in Linux
  https://gist.github.com/learncodeacademy/3cdb928c9314f98404d0


 (wherever it says url.com, use your server's domain or IP)

Login to new server as root, then add a deploy user

>> sudo useradd --create-home -s /bin/bash deploy
>> sudo adduser deploy sudo
>> sudo passwd deploy
>> password: whdeploy
>> password: [whdeploy]

And Update the new password

Now login as that user

ssh deploy@url.com
Make directory .ssh on the remote server and log out

mkdir .ssh
exit
Push your ssh key to the authorized_keys file on the remote server

scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub deploy@url.com:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
