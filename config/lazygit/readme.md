# Lazygit config

## Override settings

- [source](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md)
- I have a symlink that points to

```bash
create_symlink ~/github/dotfiles-latest/lazygit/config.yml "$HOME/Library/Application Support/lazygit/config.yml"
```

- The default config values are in the same link above, but I created a file
  `config-default.yml` to keep track of them
